# IMT-350-Robotics-II---2017-Car-controlled-by-keyboard
This project is a very structured but simple application of the robotic operating system (ROS) as a work tool used to promote the potential that this meta-system offers and also to be able to understand and make efficient use of tasks and objectives that this project seeks.
 
 
The present project makes use of the teleop_twist_keyboard node in this repository https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard to be able to operate a differential wheel robot built with the Arduino Mega hardware through the PC keyboard. Additionally, it has a subscriber node written by me, which makes possible the reception of messages by the tele-operation node, this code is the one that will be introduced to the arduino with the corresponding ROS libraries.
